<h3>About</h3>
Machine Learning Project of implementing the ID3 algorithm from scratch. <br>
This project was done in the context of a "Machine Learning" University Subject, Tested using the dataset mushroom.arff.<br>
So far takes only nominal attributes.<br>
<h3>Splits the dataset into training set and test set, to give out as a result:</h3><br>
<ul>
    <li>A visual tree of the model.</li>
    <li>The accuracy on the test set.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Execution</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Requires no external libraries, works on java 8.</li>
    <li>For the mushroom dataset, preferred is using an information gain threshold of more than 9/10.</li>
    <li>Training Size is the percentage of the dataset number of instances (although divided by 100; range between [0, 1]).</li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Note** 
</h4>
<br>
The algorithm simply ignores missing values
