Machine Learning Project of implementing the ID3 algorithm from scratch. <br>
This project was done in the context of a "Machine Learning" University Subject, Tested using the dataset mushroom.arff.<br>
Splits the dataset into training set and test set, to give out as a result:<br>
<ul>
    <li>A visual tree of the model</li>
    <li>The accuracy on the test set</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>For the mushroom dataset, preferred is using a threshold of more than 0.9</li>
    <li>Training Size is the percentage of the dataset number of instances (although divided by 100; range between [0, 1])</li>
</ul>
